                UA Room Seeker is a web app that can tell you what lecture halls
                are available to study, eat, or whatever else you'd want to do. That is,
                rooms that are free to use between classes. If the study area you're in is too loud,
                all the tables are full, or you want a whiteboard, <em>UA Room Seeker</em> can give
                you an alternative option without having to check every room first, and not know
                when you'll have to leave due to a class using the room.<br/><br/>

                Simply give a time and building to get a list of rooms and times that they will
                be free till. Please note however, that we can't guarantee that any of the rooms are
                completely empty or unlocked. The way we determine availability is by scraping publically
                available course catalogues to determine when a given room has a class or not. The room
                however might be locked, occupied by a club, or otherwise in-accessible. However, many
                of the rooms are easily accessible to all students so there is very likely no issues.<br/><br/>

                In addition, we are under no context affiliated with the University
                of Alberta, nor do we claim to be. This is simply a labour of love by some of your fellow
                students. This web app was initially developed during HackED 2020, and later fleshed out
                by Noah Gergel, Sichun Xu, Weilin Qiu, and Nina Yang. For those that are interested, the web
                scraping and server are implimented in Python 3, using the framework Flask. The front end was
                implimented using Vue.js.
